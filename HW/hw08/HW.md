Imagine that in your Digital Journal Application you have `100.000` students 
(let's say the system is used in many facilities) and MANY MANY students' marks which you process in your application.

I want the application to SEND the EMAIL with REPORT that includes:

- The total number of students
  - every month

- The total average mark
  - every day I wanna see the "Average Mark"
    - only marks from this day should be included in the analytics
    - it means that you have to add `creation_date` to your `mark` instance in the data structure

Sending reports should not block user's input process (must be IO non-blocking)
P.S You can set the `dict` as your simulated storage instead of using files
P.P.S. When you will implement a new feature you may improve the performance with multithreading / multiprocessing / asyncio.
It is optional but preferred. You can decide be yourself what component should be improved.

Calculating average mark is made for yesterday instead of today, as for today data could be incomplete

random_data_generator.py is updated, so it now creates students with marks in the past upto today (not for all days, for some days marks are missing)

I checked average mark calculation done with one process and with number of CPU processes.

Strange but one process wins for 1000 and 1000_000 students:

Copy code
Users                1000                   1000_000
One process         0.00040449993684887886  0.2397951000602916
CPU# processes      0.7411272999597713      9.727466400014237
I implemented managing many processes manually because I didn't get idea how to start ProcessPoolExecutor with passing iterable and arg (search_date) in target function. Also faced problems that multiprocessing.Manager().dict and list doesn't work in this case (typeerror: cannot pickle 'weakref.referencetype' object).

Student creation date is not tracked, so monthly new student reporting cannot be done ðŸ˜„
- Add and use a creation_date field for each student
